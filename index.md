## Research Overview

My research brings a data-driven approach to understanding the Internet's performance and security. 
I build systems that learn patterns from and collect data about network, operator, and attacker behaviors. 
I quantitatively analyze the data my systems collect to surface critical operational challenges and threats.
More details [here](assets/app_materials/ResearchStatement.pdf).

My lab consists of the following wonderful people: [Manda Tran](https://mandatran.github.io/) (Ph.D).
*I am actively recruiting students (Ph.D, masters, undergrad) and post-docs to join my lab. Email me if interested!*
