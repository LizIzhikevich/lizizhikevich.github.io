<dt>SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS LAB</dt> (July 2017- September 2018)

Collaborated with Prof. [Geoff Voelker](./http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/~voelker) and Prof. [George Porter](./http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/~gmporter/) on serverless distributed systems and security related research. Projects include:

* Sprocket: A Serverless Video Processing Framework for the Cloud 
* Co-location vulnerabilities in AWS Lambda

<dt>VOYTEK LAB FOR COGNITIVE AND COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE</dt> (Jan 2015 – September 2018)

Collaborated with Prof. [Brad Voytek](./https://voyteklab.com), [Erik Peterson](./http://www.robotpuggle.com) and [Richard Gao](./http://www.rdgao.com) on electrophysiological data analysis. Project includes: 
* analyzing the distribution of EEG, ECOG, MEG and LFP data at different frequencies to invalidate a statistical assumption of a commonly used estimating method in neuroscience (Welch's Method). Presented research results at SFN 2016 (Society For Neuroscience). Pre-print on BioRxiv; Paper submitted to Journal of Neuroscience Methods.
