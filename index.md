## Research Overview

My research brings a data-driven approach to understanding the Internet's performance and security. 
I build systems that learn patterns from and collect data about network, operator, and attacker behaviors. 
I use quantitative analysis, including rigorous statistics, on the data my systems collect to surface critical operational challenges and threats.
