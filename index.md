## Projects

EMPIRICAL SECURITY RESEARCH GROUP
January 2019 - Now
Collaborating with Prof. Zakir Durumeric and Stanford Visiting Scholar Renata Teixeira on computer network analysis and security. 

SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS LAB
July 2017- September 2018
Collaborated with Prof. Geoff Voelker and Prof. George Porter on serverless distributed systems and security related research. Projects include:
Sprocket: A Serverless Video Processing Framework for the Cloud (paper to appear at SOCC'18).

VOYTEK LAB FOR COGNITIVE AND COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE
Jan 2015 – September 2018
Collaborated with Prof. Brad Voytek, Erik Peterson and Richard Gao on electrophysiological data analysis. Project includes: 
analyzing the distribution of EEG, ECOG, MEG and LFP data at different frequencies to invalidate a statistical assumption of a commonly used estimating method in neuroscience (Welch's Method). Presented research results at SFN 2016 (Society For Neuroscience). Pre-print on BioRxiv; Paper submitted to Journal of Neuroscience Methods.

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
